Week 3 challenge - portfolio created using bootstrap
Portfolio created using custom CSS and Bootstrap. Bootstrap was used to created the Jumbrotron text, skills section and the projects section. The navbar works and scrolls to the correct sections when clicked and also includes a hover function. The Projects section images are links and divert to my GitHub when clicked. I included two images of myself to make the portfolio a bit more unique. The contact me section is a form instead of just contact details as I thought it would be good to make it a form for the future when I include Javascript in the portfolio to make the site more responsive and allow for all contact requests to filter to my email address. I tried to maintain a consistent style with the darker colors although this was broken with the skills section which has bright, vibrant colors this might not have been the best call. Overall I found this quite challenging with the most difficult aspect being editing the bootstrap components to be exactly the way I wanted. However, bootstrap was very useful for making the site more optimised for different screen sizes meaning I only had to write a few media queries. Current known bugs are that the featured image does not scale properly when the screen size is reduced (this section was not made with bootstrap). Also, the image on the about me section dissapears after reducing the viewport by only a little bit as I could not make it look good with media queries and opted to remove the image after meeting a certain breakpoint.
